# Welcome to Australia

( Australian Coat of Arms)

## Australia is very far away, almost on the other side of the world. 

- Sydney, the largest city in Australia is approximately 15,000 Kilometers away from Riga 
- In comparison, Latvia is approximately 450 kilometres across.

## Australia is a very big country.

- Latvia could fit into Australia 120 times. Australia is the world's biggest island.

## Even though Australia is big, Australia has a small population compared to the size of the country

- There are 25 million people in Australia
- This is approximately 15 times the population of Latvia
- There are countries in Europe with many more times more people than Australia 
- This is because Australia is mostly desert, and most people live in cities.

# Climate

( Map 



Australia is a huge island with many different types of climate
We have:

- Snow
- Mountains
- Desert
- Tropical Rainforest
- Regular forest


But I am from a place called Cairns and it is tropical. In cairns are rainforests, coral reefs, and tropical islands. It is very different to other places in Australia.
